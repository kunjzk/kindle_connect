*kindle_connect*

Currently only implements basic functionality:
- Connect your kindle to your computer and use this repo to generate .rst files containing your highlights from each book
- Run clippings2notion.py, passing as arguments the: v2 token of your notion account, URL of the page you'd like to write to, and the path to your .rst file

Viola, all your kindle highlights for that book are now automatically on Notion.
